- Need to install Wix toolset v3 (newer version doesn't install necessary files)



## Notes

- Why do we need to process the images at all? Can't we just do that all by reading the TIFs and combining them in various ways on the fly?
- Seems like a waste to add all that extra processing and confusion and extra files and stuff when we can just read them
- We could highlight or select specific areas of the TIFs and then scan those at increasingly higher resolutions
- Need to be educated on the different ways we are combining the bands, that part is a bit above me right now
- Can create an image grid, a set of random combinations and hues and saturations
- As well as sliders, zooming functionality, maybe some kind of depth of geographic type functionality
- And easy downloading and sending of the generated images from the canvas
